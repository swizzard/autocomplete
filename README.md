# Autocomplete-es6
ES2015-ified version of the original plugin. Mostly minor changes, for now, possibly
more TK (see below). The goal is to use good new stuff to make the code cleaner &
clearer, not to fundamentally change anything.

## Potential further changes
* `.call`/`.apply`: they're *everywhere*, I might be able to refactor a few out with `...`, etc.
* ???: I haven't done serious JS in years, and I'm just learning ES6, so who even knows.



## _Original documentation follows below_
